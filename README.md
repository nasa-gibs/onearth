# OnEarth

OnEarth is a software package consisting of image formatting and serving modules which facilitate the deployment of a web service capable of efficiently serving standards-based requests for georeferenced raster imagery (and vectors) at multiple spatial resolutions including, but not limited to, full spatial resolution.  The software was originally developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([JPL](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)) to serve global daily composites of MODIS imagery.  Since then, it has been deployed and repurposed in other installations, including at the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center ([PO.DAAC](http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/)) in support of the State of the Oceans ([SOTO](https://podaac-tools.jpl.nasa.gov/soto/)) visualization tool, the Lunar Mapping and Modeling Project ([LMMP](https://trek.nasa.gov/moon)), and [Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/).

OnEarth is actively maintained by the NASA Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) Project. For more information, visit https://earthdata.nasa.gov/gibs
