# OnEarth Demo

The OnEarth Demo includes two different demo interfaces depending on the deployment method, both available at http://localhost/demo/:

## Static Demo Page (run.sh)

The static demo page (`index.html`) is used with the `run.sh` deployment and includes:

- WMTS Tile Clients that show off sample data, status check imagery, and reprojected profiling imagery
- WMTS Tile Clients for each projection (4326, 3857, 3413, 3031) that pulls imagery from S3
- Sample requests for WMTS GetCapabilities, TWMS GetTileService, and TWMS GetCapabilities
- Pre-configured endpoints with sample imagery

## Dynamic Demo Page (Local Deployment)

The dynamic demo page is generated by `generate_demo_page.sh` and is used with the local deployment (when `setup-onearth-local.sh` is run). This script:

- **Automatically discovers** your local MRF data and endpoint configurations
- **Dynamically generates** a custom demo page based on your actual data
- **Shows real endpoints** with your actual layer counts and configurations
- **Provides interactive testing** for all your configured projections and variants

### When It's Used

The dynamic demo page is automatically generated when you run `setup-onearth-local.sh` to deploy OnEarth locally. `start_demo.sh` will check whether configuration files have been mounted at `/etc/onearth/config`. If files are found, then `generate_demo_page.sh` will be executed to create the dynamic demo page.

### What It Creates

The generated demo page includes:
- **Layer counts** for each projection and variant
- **Expandable layer lists** with links to example requests for each layer
- **Service status endpoints** for health checking
- **Setup information** showing your OnEarth version and configuration paths

### Key Differences

| Feature | Static Demo (run.sh) | Dynamic Demo (local deployment) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Data Source** | Pre-configured sample data | Your actual MRF data |
| **Endpoints** | Fixed sample endpoints | Discovered from your configs |
| **Layer Counts** | Static sample counts | Real counts from your data |
| **Configuration** | Hardcoded sample configs | Your actual layer configs |
| **Testing** | Sample URLs | Real endpoint URLs |
